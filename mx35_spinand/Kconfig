config MTD_SPINAND_MX35
	tristate "SPINAND Device Support for Macronix"
	depends on MTD_NAND && SPI
	help
	  This enables support for accessing Macronix SPI NAND flash
	  devices. Becareful that SPI NAND cannot be used to m25p80
	  driver, so you may should disable the MTD m25p80 first.
	  If you have Macronix SPI NAND chip say yes.

	  If unsure, say no here.

	help
	  Internel ECC.
	  Enables Hardware ECC support for SPI NAND.

config MTD_SPINAND_QIO
	bool "Use Quad IO Read/Write Command"
	depends on MTD_SPINAND_MX35
	help
	  Quad IO Read/Write.
	  Enables Hardware Quad IO Read/Write support for Macronix
	  SPI NAND.
